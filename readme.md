## 9 Courses and textbooks that potentially matter

This is a list from [TeachYourselfCS](https://teachyourselfcs.com) that makes sense to me. So, instead of finding excuses and blaming the unis for their ignorance, just get to it. 

In reality, everyone has business to deal with which means that it's highly possible that you will have to make time for this study in your free time, even if you are a CS major student. Take me for example, I used to work as an engineer for a short period, and now I turn to the uni for a master degree in CS (which is probably not the best choice). The curriculums in unis are always outdated because most are introductory courses which most students have to pass. As a CS major postgraduate students, I always find the courses to be out of sync with my motivation. So why not challenge myself in this kind of depressing scenario? Investing in yourself is always better than waste time complaining about things that can't be changed. 

The first three books are _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)_, _Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (CSAPP)_, and _The Algorithm Design Manual_. I used to make a mistake when reading a textbook, that is I ignore the problems and projects included which are actually more valuable to master the skills. So this time, I'll focus on the practices and labs more in the accompanied course materials/websites. 

As always, it's going to get boring when reading textbooks or doing labs, because so many new things are emerging out there. So it's good to get hands on these trendy things to feel alive. For this kind of activities, there are lots of websites and resources. (to be supplemented later)
